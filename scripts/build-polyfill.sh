# Build the core-js javascript polyfill which adds ES5 bug fixes and ES5
# features to Qt Script. All we do is copy the npm core-js package's build to
# our local `../foundation-database/nodejsshim/tables/pkgscript/core-js` directory.
# At some point, we might need a custom build of core-js, which is possible.
#
# The core-js javascript polyfill can then be loaded with:
#
#  include('core-js');
#
# Since it overrites globals and doesn't return anything, `require('core-js');`
# should not be used. Use `include('core-js');` instead.
